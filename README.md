# Summary
This script reads CSV and Excel files in a given directory and its subdirectories, removes rows with missing or null values in a specified column, and consolidates the data into a single Excel file.

# Inputs
* master_folder_path: A string containing the path to the master folder that contains the subfolders and files to be processed.

# Output
* An Excel file containing the consolidated data from all the CSV and Excel files in the given directory and its subdirectories. The file will be saved in the same location as the master folder.

# Prerequisites
The following Python modules are required:

* os: This module provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
* pandas: This module provides functions for data manipulation and analysis.

# Usage
To use the script, set the master_folder_path variable to the desired directory, and specify the column to be used for removing rows with missing or null values. Then, run the script.

# Customization
* To specify a different column for removing rows with missing or null values, change the value of the subset parameter in the dropna() function. For example, to use column "B" instead of column "A", use df.dropna(subset=["B"]).
* To save the consolidated data to a different location or with a different file name, change the value of the to_excel() function.
* To specify different file types to be processed, modify the if statement that checks the file extension.
* To skip subfolders or files with certain names, use an if statement to check the folder or file name before processing the data.

Draft 2

Requirements
Python 3
pandas library
Usage
Set the master_folder_path variable to the path of the master folder containing the subfolders and files.
Run the code.
The code will:

Iterate through the subfolders in the master folder.
Iterate through the CSV files in the subfolder.
Read the CSV file into a dataframe.
Convert the dataframe to an Excel file.
Add the file and folder information to the dataframe.
Add the dataframe to a list of dataframes.
Concatenate all the dataframes in the list into a single dataframe.
Write the consolidated data to an Excel file.
Notes
The code will skip files that are not CSV or Excel files.
If there are no subfolders in the master folder, the code will read the files in the main folder.
